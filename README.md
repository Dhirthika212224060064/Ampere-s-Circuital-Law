# Ampere’s Circuital Law

## Introduction:
 When an electric current flows through a conductor, it generates a magnetic field around it. Understanding and calculating this magnetic field is essential in electromagnetics and electrical engineering.

Ampere’s Circuital Law provides a fundamental relationship between electric current and the magnetic field it produces. It states that:

Where:

B = Magnetic field intensity

dl = Differential element of the closed path

I_enc = Total current enclosed by the path

μ₀ = Permeability of free space

## Types of Ampere’s Circuital Law Applications

Ampere’s Law is applied in different symmetrical current distributions.
Each “type” corresponds to a specific physical structure where Ampere’s Law simplifies the magnetic field calculation.
